# Vector

**Velocity Engine for Code, Tooling, Operations, and Release**

Vector is a unified development control surface that supports the full software delivery lifecycle through MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, CLI commands, and editor extensions. Its initial focus is documentation governance — creating, validating, and organizing governed documentation vaults.

## What it does

- **Documentation governance** — create, update, validate, and organize governed docs through MCP tools
- **MCP server** — stdio-based server exposing tools to any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, etc.)
- **Extensible runtime** — small core that grows through plugins, with a transport-agnostic design that supports MCP, CLI, and future frontends

## Tech stack

- **Rust** (Edition 2024, MSRV 1.95.0)
- **Async runtime**: Tokio
- **Protocol**: MCP via the `rmcp` SDK
- **Transport**: stdio

## Installation

### MCP server (`mcp-vector`)

Install the latest release directly from the repository:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/UmbrellaCorporationInc/vector mcp-vector
```

To install a specific version:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/UmbrellaCorporationInc/vector --tag v0.1.1 mcp-vector
```

**Prerequisites:** Rust 1.95.0 or later. Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

### Operator CLI (`get-vector`)

`get-vector` is a companion CLI for operators managing a local `mcp-vector` installation. It installs or updates the binary from the repository HEAD via `cargo install --git --force`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/UmbrellaCorporationInc/vector get-vector
```

Once installed, run the update command:

```sh
get-vector update-mcp-vector
```

This always installs the latest `mcp-vector` from the repository. Version-aware reconciliation (skip when already current) is planned for a future release.

### VS Code extension

Install the **Vector** extension from the VS Code marketplace, or search for `vector` in the Extensions panel.

## Configuration

### MCP client

Add the server to your MCP client configuration (e.g., `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vector": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mcp-vector"
    }
  }
}
```

Then start your MCP client. Vector exposes its tools through the MCP protocol over stdio.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UmbrellaCorporationInc/vector
cd vector
cargo build --release
```

The `mcp-vector` binary is produced at `target/release/mcp-vector`.

## Design principles

- **Decentralization** — documentation lives close to teams and codebases, not in a central silo
- **Performance** — Rust systems layer with efficient local execution
- **Extensibility** — small core, plugin-based growth
- **Configurability** — no single workflow imposed; projects define their own ways of working
